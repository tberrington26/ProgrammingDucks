            <p>The Programming Ducks website has been built to help teach young kids how to code in HTML. It will provide the basics and help foster interest in programming, so they will continue to research and practice code. </p>
            <p>It is built to appeal more to young girls, as many websites/apps that teach programming are designed more with boys in mind, rather than girls.</p>
            <p>These few lessons will provide a starting point for learning HTML by editing this webpage through the Google Inspect property. <em>As this property is blocked on some school managed Chromebooks, a different device will need to be used.</em></p>
            <p>Once these few lessons have been completed, resources will be provided that will allow for further exploration of HTML and CSS.</p>
